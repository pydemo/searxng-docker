# Troubleshooting SearXNG Docker Service: From Crashes to Success

*Published: September 5, 2025*

## Introduction

SearXNG is a powerful, privacy-focused metasearch engine that aggregates results from multiple search engines without tracking users. When deployed via Docker, it provides an excellent self-hosted search solution. However, like any complex service, it can encounter configuration issues that prevent it from starting properly.

In this blog post, I'll walk you through a real troubleshooting session where we diagnosed and fixed a SearXNG Docker deployment that was experiencing crashes and rate limiting issues.

## The Problem

The user was experiencing issues with their SearXNG Docker setup. The symptoms were:

1. **Container crashes**: The `searxng` container would start but then exit with status code 1
2. **Rate limiting errors**: When attempting to access the service, users received "Too Many Requests" responses
3. **Service unavailability**: The search functionality was completely inaccessible

Let's dive into the step-by-step troubleshooting process.

## Step 1: Diagnosing the Container Status

First, we checked the current state of all Docker containers:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

**Key Finding**: The searxng container showed `Exited (1)` status, indicating it had crashed. Meanwhile, other containers (caddy, redis) were running normally.

## Step 2: Examining Container Logs

The most crucial step in any Docker troubleshooting is checking the logs:

```bash
docker logs searxng
```

**Critical Discovery**: The logs revealed the root cause:

```
2025-09-05 14:58:28,663 ERROR:searx.webapp: server.secret_key is not changed. 
Please use something else instead of ultrasecretkey.
[ERROR] Unexpected exit from worker-1
[INFO] Shutting down granian
```

This error message was clear: SearXNG was refusing to start because the default secret key hadn't been changed from `ultrasecretkey`.

## Step 3: Understanding the Security Requirement

SearXNG requires a unique secret key for security purposes. The default value `ultrasecretkey` is intentionally insecure and must be replaced with a cryptographically secure random string.

## Step 4: Generating a Secure Secret Key

We generated a proper secret key using OpenSSL:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

This produced a 64-character hexadecimal string: `006e8b7683b3266e587bf00c0b0f1cfea2b7822bd1d6b2c8d74d0b80f0d1b051`

## Step 5: Updating the Configuration

We examined the current SearXNG settings:

```bash
cat searxng/settings.yml
```

The configuration showed:

```yaml
server:
  secret_key: "ultrasecretkey"  # change this!
  limiter: true
  # ... other settings
```

We updated the secret key:

```yaml
server:
  secret_key: "006e8b7683b3266e587bf00c0b0f1cfea2b7822bd1d6b2c8d74d0b80f0d1b051"  # generated secure key
  limiter: true
  # ... other settings
```

## Step 6: Restarting the Service

After updating the configuration, we restarted the Docker services:

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

## Step 7: Testing the Fix

We checked if the container was now running properly:

```bash
docker ps
```

**Success**: The searxng container was now showing as "Up" with port 8080 exposed.

However, when we tested the service:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/search?q=test&format=json"
```

We still received: `Too Many Requests`

## Step 8: Addressing Rate Limiting Issues

The "Too Many Requests" error indicated that the built-in rate limiter was being overly restrictive. We had two options:

### Option A: Whitelist Local IPs
We could add localhost IPs to the pass list in `searxng/limiter.toml`:

```toml
[botdetection.ip_lists]
block_ip = []
pass_ip = [
  "127.0.0.1",
  "::1"
]
```

### Option B: Disable Rate Limiting (Chosen Solution)
For testing and private use, we disabled the limiter entirely by updating `searxng/settings.yml`:

```yaml
server:
  limiter: false  # disabled for testing
```

## Step 9: Final Restart and Verification

After disabling the rate limiter, we restarted the searxng container:

```bash
docker compose restart searxng
```

## Step 10: Success Verification

Finally, we tested the service:

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/search?q=buzunov&format=json" | head -20
```

**Result**: The service returned proper JSON search results with data from multiple search engines (Google, DuckDuckGo, Startpage, Brave), confirming that SearXNG was fully operational.

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Always Check the Logs First
Container logs are the most valuable source of information when troubleshooting Docker services. The error message clearly indicated the secret key issue.

### 2. Security Requirements Matter
Modern applications often have built-in security checks that prevent them from running with default/insecure configurations. This is a good practice that forces administrators to properly configure their services.

### 3. Rate Limiting Can Be Overly Aggressive
Default rate limiting configurations are often designed for public-facing services and may be too restrictive for private or development use.

### 4. Configuration Changes Require Restarts
Always restart services after making configuration changes to ensure they take effect.

## Best Practices for SearXNG Deployment

### 1. Secret Key Management
- Always generate a unique secret key for each deployment
- Use cryptographically secure random generators
- Store secret keys securely and never commit them to version control

### 2. Rate Limiting Configuration
- For private instances, consider disabling or relaxing rate limits
- For public instances, configure IP whitelisting for trusted sources
- Monitor rate limiting logs to adjust thresholds as needed

### 3. Monitoring and Logging
- Regularly check container logs for errors
- Set up log rotation to prevent disk space issues
- Consider implementing monitoring alerts for container failures

## Step 11: Creating a Personal Fork for Configuration Management

After successfully fixing the SearXNG service, it's important to preserve our custom configurations. Rather than losing our changes or having them overwritten by upstream updates, we created a personal fork of the repository.

### Setting Up the Fork

First, we renamed the original remote to `upstream` to preserve the connection to the official repository:

```bash
git remote rename origin upstream
```

Then we added our personal GitHub repository as the new `origin`:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/pydemo/searxng-docker.git
```

### Committing Our Changes

We checked the current status to see what files had been modified:

```bash
git status
```

**Files Modified:**
- `.env` - Environment configuration
- `docker-compose.yaml` - Docker service definitions  
- `searxng/limiter.toml` - Rate limiting configuration
- `searxng/settings.yml` - Main SearXNG settings (including our secure secret key)

**New Files:**
- `blog.md` - This troubleshooting documentation

We staged all changes and committed them:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "My custom changes to searxng-docker"
```

Finally, we pushed our changes to our personal fork:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

### Benefits of Forking

Creating a personal fork provides several advantages:

1. **Configuration Preservation**: Our custom settings are safely stored and version-controlled
2. **Easy Deployment**: We can clone our fork on other systems with our configurations intact
3. **Update Management**: We can selectively merge updates from upstream while preserving our customizations
4. **Collaboration**: Team members can use the same tested configuration
5. **Rollback Capability**: We can easily revert to working configurations if needed

### Keep Upstream in Sync (Optional but Recommended)

So you can pull new updates from the original repo later:

```bash
# fetch updates from original repo
git fetch upstream

# merge/rebase into your branch when needed
git merge upstream/master
```

### Future Maintenance

To keep our fork updated with upstream changes while preserving our customizations:

```bash
# Fetch updates from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Merge upstream changes (resolve conflicts if needed)
git merge upstream/master

# Push updated fork
git push origin master
```

## Conclusion

This troubleshooting session demonstrates the importance of systematic problem-solving when dealing with containerized applications. By following a logical progression from symptom identification to root cause analysis and finally to solution implementation, we successfully resolved both the container crashes and rate limiting issues.

The key takeaways are:
1. **Secret key misconfiguration** was the primary cause of container crashes
2. **Rate limiting** was preventing normal usage even after the service started
3. **Proper configuration management** is essential for reliable service operation
4. **Version control** helps preserve working configurations and enables easy deployment

SearXNG is now running successfully and providing search results from multiple engines while maintaining user privacy. The service is accessible via both the web interface at `http://localhost:8080/` and the JSON API at `http://localhost:8080/search?q=QUERY&format=json`.

Our custom configuration is now safely stored in a personal fork at `https://github.com/pydemo/searxng-docker.git`, making it easy to deploy the same working setup on other systems or share with team members.

For production deployments, remember to re-enable and properly configure rate limiting to protect against abuse while ensuring legitimate users can access the service effectively.
